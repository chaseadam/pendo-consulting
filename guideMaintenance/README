requires environment variables with your session ID. Recommend adding these to your bashrc or creating a file which you can source on the command line (syntax is ". <filename>")

export PENDO_SUBSCRIPTION=###
export PENDO_USER=###
export PENDO_SESS='<sessionId>'

This tool uses the "true" address of pendo application (https://pendo-io.appspot.com) due to SSL shenanigans.

You can get the subscription and user fron the "impersonate.subscription" network call in the UI when you impersonate or unimpersonate.
example https://app.pendo.io/api/s/<subscrptionId>/user/<userId>/setting/impersonate.subscription

sessionId is available in sight settings under "Session" https://pendo-io.appspot.com/admin

The script will automatically impersonate whatever you have set in the UI, but you still need to set the pendo subscription id.

Syntax should be built into the script, but examples below.

All commands must be run in parent directory, not guide directories
python ./commandline.py down
python ./commandline.py down -g <guideId>
python ./commandline.py up -g <guideId>
python ./commandline.py up -g <guideId> -y
